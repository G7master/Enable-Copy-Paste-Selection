# Enable Copy, Paste & Text Selection

This lightweight browser extension enables text selection, copy, and paste on websites that block it using JavaScript or CSS — without breaking interactive elements like checkboxes or forms.

## ✅ Features
- Enables text selection on right-click–disabled websites
- Restores copy/paste functionality
- Keeps checkboxes and buttons working
- Works on Shadow DOMs and dynamically loaded content

## 🧠 How It Works
The extension removes `user-select: none` styles and unbinds JavaScript event listeners that block selection — without interfering with legitimate interactive behavior.

## 🔒 Privacy
This extension **does not collect, track, or transmit any data**. All actions are executed locally in the browser only when triggered.

## 📦 Install
Coming soon to:
- [Chrome Web Store](#)
- [Microsoft Edge Add-ons](#)
- [IOS Safari Add-ons](#)

## 🛠 Manual Install
1. Download or clone this repo
2. Open `chrome://extensions` (or Edge/Safari equivalent)
3. Enable "Developer Mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder
